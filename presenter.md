# Intro
We're not going to be talking about the macOS package manager or video games, but about making beer at home.

Most of the things I'll talk about today are specific brewing ales, but theapply more or less to all other styles as well.

# Why brew
* too cheap to buy beer
* live in a country where alcohol is illegal to purchase
* you have too much free time
* I had a friend lend me some equipment when they moved and that pretty much got me started.

# Basic ingredients
* grain - cereal grains usually barley
* hops - so many varieties
* yeast - based on style specific strains
* water - basically 95% of what beer is

## Grain
Germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as "malting".

The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.

Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar.

The color of the grains directly affects the color of the beer you get.

## Hops
Bitterness – this balances the sweetness of the malt.

Flavor – Besides bitterness hops add floral, citrus and herbal flavors and aroma.

Head Retention – Hops aid in head retention i.e how long the head of beer lasts after being poured into a glass.

Antibiotic Effect – helps promote the brewer’s yeast instead of other unfavorable microorganisms.

## Yeast
Yeast are single-celled microorganisms that reproduce by budding.

They are biologically classified as fungi and are responsible for converting fermentable sugars into alcohol and other byproducts.

There are literally hundreds of varieties and strains of yeast.

## Water
The water used in brewing is quite important for the final taste of the beer.

Depending on the water profile of the geographic area in there may be different minerals in the water.

You can use distilled water and add minerals if you are lookin for a specific water profile.

For example hard water is better suited for making stouts, whereas softer water is better for ales.

# What's cooking?
Brewing beer at home is a lot like cooking, except it takes a lot longer and the clean-up is even less fun.

The results however are usually quite satisfying.

## Brewing with Malt Extract
  * not inferior to all-grain
  * easier
  * less time
  * less equipment and space needed
  * a bit more expensive

## Brewing All-Grain Beer
  * exactly what it sounds like
  * no need for a mash tun we steep the grains in the pot (in a bag)
